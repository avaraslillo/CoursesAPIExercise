Develop simple rest api, in any language of your choosing, which manages "Course" records:
- The api should manage the following information about a Course: id, subject, courseNumber, description. All fields other than id are strings
- courseNumber must be formatted as a three-digit, zero-padded integer like "033". Adding records which are not three-digit numbers results in an validation message to the user
- The api should allow user to search for a course by description, with partial matches like "Bio" would find "Introduction to Biology"
- The api should support deleting a Course
- The api should support inserting a new Course
- The api should prevent inserting duplicate courses, where subject and number must be unique
- The api must be started with minimal setup using readily available libraries (e.g. `npm start` for Node.js) and sufficiently described in a README.md
- The api must be complete and sent as a zipped package over email or a github link

Example Course records:
1, "BIO", 101, "Introduction to Biology"
2, "MAT", 045, "Business Statistics"
